These Terms of Use govern all use of the Going Walkabout website and all content, services and products available at or through the mobile applications and website (collectively, the “Service”). 

The Service is offered subject to your acceptance without modification of all of the Terms of Use contained herein and all other operating rules, policies (including, without limitation, Going Walkabout’s Privacy Policy) and procedures that may be published from time to time on the Going Walkabout website (collectively, the “Agreement”).

Failure to do so constitutes a breach of the Terms of Use, which may result in immediate termination of your account on Going Walkabout.

Our Service allows you to post, link, store, share and otherwise make available certain information, text, graphics, videos, location data or other material ("Content").

You agree that this license includes the right for us to make your Content available in accordance with your privacy settings, to other users of the Service, who may also use your Content subject to these Terms. If you delete Content, we will use reasonable efforts to remove it from the Website and mobile Applications, but you acknowledge that caching or references to the Content may not be made immediately unavailable.

You represent and warrant that the Content is yours (you own it) or you have the right to use it and grant us the rights and license as provided in these Terms of Use, and the posting of your Content on or through the Service does not violate the privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, contract rights or any other rights of any person.
